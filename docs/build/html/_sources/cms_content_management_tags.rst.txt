Content management tags
===============================

The content management tags field exists on all of the legal content-related content types:

* Legal content
* ADRM content
* Portal main page content
* Toolbox content
* Toolbox tool content
* Toolbox tool step content

The `content management tags taxonomy <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/content_management_tags/overview>`_ works a little differently than most of our taxonomies:

* Users can add a taxonomy term directly within the legal content edit forms.  New terms will be added automatically.  
* If the term already exists, it will show in the autocomplete drop down.  
* The autocomplete requires 3 characters to work correctly; avoid tags of less than 3 characters.

.. warning:: 
   Duplicate terms will be created if someone adds a term that already exists without picking it off the drop down. 
   
Legal content can be filtered by tag(s) on the Find Legal Content report.
