==========================
Tagging content
==========================

By Topic
============
The legal issues taxonomy:

* is used to tag legal content at a granular legal issue
* the top 2 levels are used as navigation within the website

The navigational IA:
* Has terms created
* All legal content has been updated to use this as its primary navigational terms


Best practices
-----------------

* Tag the content to the best category you can find. One is the goal - only tag multiple categories if the content truly fits both places.

* If you tag a piece of content to a taxonomy tag that starts with "another" or "other," **do not tag that piece of content to any other taxonomy tags**


By user role
===============

We can also tag legal content by user role, using the taxonomy used for online intake. Content should be tagged to a user role when:

* The content is specifically written for that audience OR
* the content is especially relevant to that audience (more so than the general website visitor population)
