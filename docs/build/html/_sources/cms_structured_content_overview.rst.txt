Structured Content Overview
=============================

Structured legal content is designed to offer a way of delivering legal information across channels, whether it be the web, SMS, chatbots, or voice services. It is structured to be problem/solution-focused.  

Every problem in our structured content:

* has a description of the problem
* may have one or more questions that help more fully describe the problem.  Each question:
  
  * has an accepted answer
  * may have suggested answers
  * has a jurisdiction associated 

* has one or more defined possible solutions that offers:

  * Step-by-step instructions to solve the problem.  Each step section:
  
    * Includes one or more steps
    * An optional title
    * Each step consists of one or more directions or tips 
     
  * Eligibility information for the solution 
  * Information needed to complete the solution
  * Any helpful organizations that may be relevant
  * Forms needed to complete the solution.  This includes:
  
    * The name of the court form
    * What the form is filled out with (name, type of program, link)
    * Jurisdiction 
    * When it may or may not be used (optional)
    
  * Jurisdiction applicable to the solution.  
  * Expected result from completing the solution  

* May have prevention solutions, which are based on the same solution 
* May have related resources    

.. note::  
   We've stored jurisdiction data on questions, forms, and solutions which allows us to tailor responses based on the user's location.  Steps should also have a jurisdiction associated with them.
   
Content formats
=================

We have defined two key formats for text-based markup:

* the list format.  
* a structured text format

Both formats rely on the "paired content markup" that translates HTML text into plain text with footnoted urls, which will work better on non-web channels.
