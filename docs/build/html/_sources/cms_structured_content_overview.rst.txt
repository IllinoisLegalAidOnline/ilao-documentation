Structured content (COPE content) Overview
=============================================

Structured content types were defined in the CMS as a move towards Create Once Publish Everywhere (COPE)

There are [x] types of structured content:

* DIY Legal Solution - this provides an introduction section and then links to other content including other structured content formats (DIY Legal solutions, legal options, legal questions) and other non-structured content (Guides, other related resources)
* Legal options - this provides:

  * legal difficulty
  * eligibility rules
  * results expected
  * links to step-by-step instructions
  * references to non-legal helpful organizations
  * references to legal organizations

* Legal how-to

  * time required to complete the how-to
  * Contains 1 or more step sections; the step sections references 1 or more legal steps

* Legal step

  * Has a type (direction or step)
  * Links to legal forms needed
  * Is jurisdiction-based

* Legal question - supplemental information relevant to the DIY Legal solution, legal option, or otherwise independent related questions. Each question includes:

  * An accepted answer, which is jurisdiction-based
  * Links to other questions
  * Links to other resources

* Legal forms

See the authoring guide for how to build each of these content types.
See the website layouts section for how these appear on the website.



Content formats
=================

We have defined two key formats for text-based markup:

* the list format.
* a structured text format

Both formats rely on the "paired content markup" that translates HTML text into plain text with footnoted urls, which will work better on non-web channels.
