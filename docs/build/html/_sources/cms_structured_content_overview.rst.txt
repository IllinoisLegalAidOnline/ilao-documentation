DIY Legal Solutions Overview
=============================

DIY Legal Solutions (formerly structured legal content) is designed to offer a way of delivering legal information across channels, whether it be the web, SMS, chatbots, or voice services. It is structured to be problem/solution-focused.

Every  DIY Legal Solution packages:

* starts with a defined problem
* has a description of the problem
* may have one or more questions that help more fully describe the problem. Each question:

  * has an accepted answer
  * may have suggested answers
  * has a jurisdiction associated

* has one or more defined possible solutions that offers:

  * Step-by-step instructions to solve the problem. Each step section:

    * Includes one or more steps
    * An optional title
    * Each step consists of one or more directions or tips
    * Any legal forms necessary to complete the step

  * Eligibility information for the solution
  * Information needed to complete the solution
  * Any helpful organizations that may be relevant
  * Jurisdiction applicable to the solution.
  * Expected result from completing the solution. This may include segments of text and/or structured lists.

* May have a primary and secondary prevention solutions, which are based on the same solution structure
* May have related resources

.. note::
   We've stored jurisdiction data on questions, steps, how-tos, forms, and solutions which allows us to tailor responses based on the user's location. There are 2 jurisdiction fields available:

   * Jurisdiction - this is required
   * Negate jurisdiction - this is optional and is used to exclude an area from the jurisdiction (for example, to set something to "all but Cook county", you can set the jurisdiction to Illinois and the negate jurisdiction to Cook county).


Content formats
=================

We have defined two key formats for text-based markup:

* the list format.
* a structured text format

Both formats rely on the "paired content markup" that translates HTML text into plain text with footnoted urls, which will work better on non-web channels.
