Next generation content/COPE
==============================

ILAO's structured content types were created to create a "Create Once Publish Everywhere" model based on a problem/solution(s) approach.


It evolved from much of ILAO's work over the last twenty years, including:

* Improving the way we create and manage jurisdiction specific content
* Trying to streamline legal information into more actionable pieces
* Improving the ability to reuse legal information
* Create clearer structure for legal information rather than
* Breaking large chunks of text into smaller pieces that can be delivered in different ways more easily. For example:

  * Displaying a list of question titles on a single page
  * Displaying a single question on a page
  * Providing a list of steps over SMS and asking the user which step they'd like to read.
  * Delivering a select step over multiple text messages with no HTML formatting and with logical breaks, which is not supported on SMS
  * Delivering a list of items as a bulleted list on desktop, a swipe left/right grid on mobile, and with asterisk-prefixed items on SMS from the same piece of content
  * Delivering a list of steps in a solution over an API into an instance of Legal Server where a case worker can then select the step to send to a client after providing basic advice


It is modeled after various elements of schema.org. Because there is no legal problem type in schema.org, ILAO modeled its standard on schema.org medical structures as well as more standardized types like article, how to, organizations, question, and forms.
