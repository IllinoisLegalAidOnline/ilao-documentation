Creating and editing structured content
========================================


Structured legal content needs to be created in a specific ways as certain content types depend on other content types.    

* Legal problems:

  * require a solution, which must be created first.  A legal problem **cannot be saved** without a valid solution.
  * allow for frequently asked questions, which must be created first and attached.
  
* Solutions have optional components that must exist to be attached to a legal solution.  These are:

  * Legal form
  * Legal how-to
  * Helpful organization
  
* Legal how-tos require Legal steps, which must be created first.
