Structured Text & Lists
============================


The structured text and lists component is designed to support either paired markup or structured lists that exist in otherwise unstructured text.

.. note:: For lists such as steps in a How-to and questions in a FAQ, structure is automatically enforced.  But in freestanding text like eligibility rules or answers to questions, we need more structure around lists when those are appropriate to use.

The component is used in:

* Legal solution (for eligibility rules and result)
* Legal question (for answers and suggested answers)
