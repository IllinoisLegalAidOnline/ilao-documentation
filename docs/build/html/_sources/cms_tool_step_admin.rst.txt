My Progress block
======================
The "My Progress" block tracks a user's progress across the tool.  

* For logged in users, it will remember their progress over the course of 1 year.
* For anonymous users, it will remember their progress only for the current session.

.. note::  This is a change from the Drupal 7 site where the 'return code' allowed users to return.

As a user progresses through a tool:

* The current step, if it has not been previously marked complete, will be blue and filled
* Incomplete steps will be white with a blue border
* Steps that are marked complete will be green with a check in them
