Word counts
===================

The system calculates word counts and stores this value on legal content and ADRM content as follows:

* Only legal content that contains a body field (text articles, how-to articles, guides, and video) have word counts. 
* ADRM content only supports text fields
* Metadata fields like titles, descriptions, etc are not included in any count.

.. note:: Because only legal content and ADRM content can be edited by legal aid members and are the only content types under moderation, they are the only content types currently with a word count field.
