=====================
Custom autcomplete
=====================

Google manages the autocomplete terms that appear when a user searches our site based on our search corpus and searches that commonly map to our site. We can:

* include additional specific autocompletes
* exclude specific autocompletes.

Autocomplete terms can be scored from 1 to 10000; higher scored terms will appear higher when they match the user's input. For example, if I indicate that divorce with children should have a score of 10000 and divorce and taxes should have a score of 5, divorce with children will appear higher up when the user starts to type divorce.

.. todo:: Currently, only Gwen can manage autocompletes. We will be launching a tool soon to allow the staff to submit autocompletes to include/exclude.
