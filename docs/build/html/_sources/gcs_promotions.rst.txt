Search promotions
=======================

We can create one or more promotions to appear in search results when a user searches a specific query. This can be used for a variety of purposes:

* To promote a new resource before it is indexed by Google
* To guide uses to a specific resource that may not rank high enough or compete with other resources. For example, we want to direct users looking for eviction information to our Eviction Help Illinois page over other content.

.. todo:: As of April 2023, Gwen is the only person who can create a promotion. In June 2023, we expect to release a tool for staff to view all promotions and submit requests for new ones.

Below is an example of the New Leaf Portal promotion when a user searches for cannabis:
