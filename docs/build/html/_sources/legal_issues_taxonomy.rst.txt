Legal Issues Taxonomy
==========================

The Legal issues IA is a complex taxonomy for categorizing legal information. It is poly-hierarchical.  

It will be replaced on the website front-end in the future.  See :ref:`taxonomy-status-label` 

Taxonomy Structure
====================

Each taxonomy term has:
* a name
* a description.  This is used on subcategory and category pages.
* whether it should be used in the autosuggest on Get Legal Help
* alternatives (these can be helpful for autocompletes)
* an icon.  This is only needed on the top level categories.  The icon is per language.
* an image.  This is used on category and subcategory pages.  The image is limited to one for all languages

.. note:: The top content field has been deprecated.


Use Cases
=======================

This is currently used:

* For front-end navigation
* To define the legal issues an organization takes in its services for referrals
* To limit triage rules for OTIS to specific legal issues
* To limit intake settings for OTIS to specific legal issues
* To help users drill down to their legal issues in Get Legal Help
