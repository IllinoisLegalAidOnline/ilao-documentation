Next Steps: Overview
==========================

Next Steps build on the work done with COPE content to define step-by-step legal processes (How-tos) associated with a specific DIY Legal Solution and its options. This adds a content type designed to deliver interactive follow-up messages initially over SMS.

How this differs from the Toolbox ticker system
=================================================

Some staff may recall that we piloted a similar concept with toolbox content. We've learned from that failure and have made the following improvements in this iteration:

* Messages are kept separate from the content associated with it
* Users can reply to a message and those replies are then processed to determine the next step
* Messages are created within a flow; this allows us to see the entire conversational process.
