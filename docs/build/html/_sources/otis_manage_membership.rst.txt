===========================
Organization "group" roles
===========================


Organizations have their own membership roles, separate from the user roles that ILAO staff manage when approving users.  Most users are not assigned any role other than the default "member." 

There are 3 specialty permissions that grant access to specific organization tools:

* Organization manager
* OAS manager
* Fast entry user

All legal aid members can add and edit their own job postings and calendar events.  Organization managers can no longer edit job postings or events posted by other users.

Organization manager
======================
Organization managers can edit the organization profile, locations, and services and have a custom block on their dashboard to link to these pages.

Organization managers can also manage members within their organization including:

* adding users to their organization
* removing members from their organization
* editing the group permissions associated with a member of their organization

OTIS manager
=============
OTIS managers can do everything an organization manager can do plus:

* Edit triage rule content
* Edit triage webforms
* Edit intake settings

.. note:: As of November 13, 2020 triage rule webforms and intake settings are not yet editable by OTIS managers.


Coming soon:  Fast entry user
===============================

The fast entry user has access to the fast entry intake form (once complete).
