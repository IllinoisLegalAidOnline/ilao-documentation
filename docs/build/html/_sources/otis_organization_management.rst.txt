Organization management
=============================

Organization serve as the core owner of locations, services, and triage rules.  Legal aid members are associated with an organization.

Organizations have their own membership roles, separate from the user roles that ILAO staff manage when approving users.  Most users are not assigned any role other than the default "member."  Users who need to be able to manage the organization's profile, locations, services, triage rules and/or intake settings should be given the Organization Manager role.

Users who have the Organization Manager role have a dashboard that includes a block with links to manage their organization data.  This includes links to:

* Edit the organization description
* Edit the organizations' content (triage rules, locations, services)
* Manage intake settings
* View their triage and intake report
