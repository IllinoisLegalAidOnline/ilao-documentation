Manipulating Search
=========================

Synonyms
==========

The search synonyms taxonomy allows us to:

* Replace a search term with another search term
* Expand a search term with additional search terms

The search synonym taxonomy:

* The name is the search term as entered by the user
* The description is what is used to replace or expand
* The synonym type is either:

  * Replace name with description.
  * Add description terms to name.

Replacing a search term
-------------------------
This feature is helpful for misspellings. For example, a synonym of divrce with a description of divorce will result in the system searching just for divorce.


Add description terms to name
-------------------------------
This feature is helpful for true synonyms. For example, adding weed as a synonym for cannabis with a type of "add description terms to name" will return content with either term.
