Manually indexing
==================

.. note:: Product team staff run this task manually as needed.  Other users with the content manager role may run this if needed but the preferred approach is to open a support ticket.

Go to the indexing page under `Configuration->Search and metadata->Search API->Acquia Search Solr Index <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/config/search/search-api/index/acquia_search_index>`_.

When the queue can't keep up with content changes, we may need to run the indexing manually.  See the above image:

* The index status will show a percentage indexed.
* When this is less than 100%, pressing the Index now will cause the backlog to clear
* Do not close your browser window until the queue is cleared.
