Testimonials Content Type
==========================

The testimonials content type is used to store positive stories that can be highlighted on the home page and within content.


The content type supports:

* a person name.  This can be the first name of the actual user or a fictionalized name for anonymous content.  Gender-neutral names are preferred for fictionalized names.
* a person image.  This image should be resized to be relatively small before being uploaded to decrease page load time on the home page and in content as it is a small image generally.  225x190 is a good size.  
* Legal issue the person got help with.  This is the narrative ILAO provides that includes what the user was looking for, what content (with links) the user accessed.  It also includes the month and year of the feedback.  It should not have any leading -- or other characters
* Body.  This is where the quote from the user feedback should go.
* Primary legal category.  The best primary category that the feedback should be associated with.  
* The date submitted
* The feedback source.
