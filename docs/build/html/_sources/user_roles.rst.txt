Account Roles
======================

We have the following roles:

 * Legal self-help center navigator.  This should be given to navigators of LSHC locations that need to be able to post jobs, events, or manage their organization's profile.  
 * Law student member.  This is given automatically to anyone registering with a .edu email address.  Law school staff at legal aid clinics are manually given other permissions as needed.
 * Pro bono member.  Lawyers, paralegals who indicate when registering are given this role.  Pro bono members can post jobs, events, and access legal content restricted to pro bono users.
 * Legal aid member.  This should be limited to users who are current employees of a legal aid organization.  If the user registered with a legal aid organization email, they will automatically be given this role.  Volunteers at legal aid organizations should be given pro bono permissions.
 * Translator.  This role is not active currently.
 * Subject matter expert.  This role is not actively used but will be used to indicate that the user is a legal content volunteer as we build out our gamification features.
 * Intern.  An intern at ILAO
 * Staff.  A staff member at ILAO.  This user has elevated permissions and can do most anything on the website.  
 * Content manager.  A member of the legal content team.  This role is used exclusively to determine who gets content-related emails.
 
..note:: Community members are not given any of the above roles.  They are just "authenticated" (that is, they can log in and access the basic permissions that all logged-in roles have).
