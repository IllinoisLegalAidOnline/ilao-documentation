<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Many Guides do not follow this standard currently. As we work on transforming content, that should be revisited.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For DIY Legal Solutions, titles should be user-centric. Examples may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I need help lowering my rent</p></li>
<li><p>My SNAP benefits were cut</p></li>
<li><p>Someone stole my identity</p></li>

<li><p>Participate in the case,</p></li>
<li><p>File for Chapter 13 bankruptcy</p></li>
<li><p>Create a safety plan, including someplace to go</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Legal questions should be written as questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is domestic violence?</p></li>
<li><p>How much in SNAP benefits can I get?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Legal steps should be action oriented:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fill out your forms,</p></li>
<li><p>File your forms,</p></li>
<li><p>Go to your hearing,</p></li>
<li><p>Wait.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Preserving URLs when changing titles - When changing a title, uncheck the box next to “Generate automatic alias” so that the URL stays the same. This is so that our Google Analytics tracking for the page will be preserved.</p>

<section id="descriptions">
<h2>Descriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#descriptions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We have 2 different description fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Meta description - this is used in Metatags so they are used by Google, Facebook, and Twitter in creating search results, snipppets, and automatic sharing on social media platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Content description is used in the navigation drill-downs and in the Solr search results.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The meta descriptions will get used in site search when we move to Google site search; at that point we may start to consider deprecating the content description field.</p>
</div>
<p>Good meta descriptions are short blurbs that describe accurately the content of the page. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they’re looking for. They should provide additional “information scent” for the user to decide if this is the help they are looking for. While the content and meta description can be the same, they do not have to be. The meta description is especially important because it, along with the title, may be all the user sees to decide if this is the page they want to go to.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In the examples, the better options are user-centric. This is a shift from our approach of starting descriptions with “Explains.”</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Descriptions should not repeat/mimic the title.</strong></p>
<section id="examples">

<li><p>Acceptable: Explains the basics of divorce, including requirements, timeline and fees.</p></li>
<li><p>Better: Learn about the requirements, timeline, and what happens during a divorce.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>DIY Legal solution: I have a cannabis arrest or conviction</p>

<p>DIY Legal solution: I don’t feel safe because of my partner, family member, or someone in my household</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bad: Explains what to do if you don’t feel safe.</p></li>
<li><p>Good: Explains how to use an order of protection to keep yourself safe.</p></li>
<li><p>Better: Explains what domestic abuse is and the legal tools you may have to get help.</p></li>
<li><p>Also better: Understand what domestic abuse is and how the law can protect you.</p></li>
<li><p>Best: Use orders of protection to protect yourself from abuse.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>DIY Legal solution: I am being evicted because I did not pay the rent</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bad: Explains what to do if you are being evicted because you did not pay the rent</p></li>
<li><p>Better: From negotiating with your landlord to going to court, you have options if you are being evicted.</p></li>

<p>If you are using a new image:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use iStock to find a photo that is engaging and describes the content. Download the Small version and put it on Team Drive in the “Stock photos for content” folder in the appropriate sub-folder.</p></li>
<li><p>The images that will work best are horizontal images with the subject(s) in the center of the image. If the subject is on the outer edge it could be cropped out so adjust the photo yourself using a crop tool.</p></li>

<h2>Legal position<a class="headerlink" href="#legal-position" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Use “Neutral” unless the content is only talking about one side in a legal proceeding. For example, if the content is telling the user how to change your name, you would set this to Plaintiff. If the content is talking about how to defend against a debt collection lawsuit, set this to Defendant (but note that if the content is talking about the other side - how to collect a judgment - it would be Plaintiff).</p>
<p>For DIY Legal Solutions, these are almost always written with a particular side in mind and should rarely be marked neutral.</p>
<p>Be careful to use the actual position in the case. For example, for criminal records, you are the plaintiff, because you are filing a petition to expunge. You are not the defendant (even though you were in the criminal case).</p>

<section id="content-level">
<h2>Content level<a class="headerlink" href="#content-level" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>

<section id="jurisdiction">
<h2>Jurisdiction<a class="headerlink" href="#jurisdiction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Most of our content is “All of Illinois,” but if the content applies to federal law (Immigration, Bankruptcy, etc.) or only a specific locality (usually Cook County or Chicago) you can indicate that here.</p>
<p>For structured content, there are 2 separate jurisdiction fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Jurisdiction is used to set the overall jurisdiction and should be set to the largest applicable area.</p></li>
<li><p>Negate jurisdiction is optional and can be used to exclude a county, city, or zip code(s) from the jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A solution applies to all of Illinois. It should have a jurisdiction of Illinois and negate jurisdiction removed.</p></li>
<li><p>A legal step applies to Cook county except for the city of Chicago. It should have a jurisdiction of Cook county and a negate jurisdiction of Chicago.</p></li>
<li><p>A legal step applies to all of Illinois except for Cook county. It should have a jurisdiction of Illinois and a negate jurisdiction of Cook county.</p></li>

<p>When working with paired markup,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bulleted lists, if they otherwise comply with this style guide, may be used. If working with a structured text block that allows for structured lists, those should be used instead of bulleted lists within a paired markup element.</p></li>

<section id="glossary-terms-definitions">
<h2>Glossary terms/definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#glossary-terms-definitions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Try and avoid using terms that need to be defined.</p>
<p>If the word/term needs a definition:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>define it using plain language once in the content, if it is a short definition. If the word/term is used more than once in the content, make sure it is included in the glossary as we will rely on the glossary for the times it is used after it is first defined.</p></li>
<li><p>consider making it a legal question that can be linked to, if the definition needs to be more than one sentence long. For example, the definition of economic abuse is multiple sentences and includes a bulleted list and is better suited as a legal question that can be linked to in articles rather than defined multiple times in individual guides or solutions.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

<h2>Point of view<a class="headerlink" href="#point-of-view" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Use 3rd person when giving general information, or when using 2nd person would be confusing or would result in awkward phrasing. Use 2nd person when you are giving the user instructions. Often, an article will start in 3rd person (because it’s general information) and then shift into 2nd person when the info becomes more specific and you start giving instructions.</p>
<p>Good example</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>When parents live in different states or a child and their parents move from one state
 to another, there are laws about which state’s courts can decide issues about the
 custody of the child. [3rd person because it is general info and using 2nd person
 would be awkward] [a few sentences later...] If jurisdiction is an issue in your
 case, you should talk to a lawyer. [2nd person because it tells the user to do
 something]
</pre></div>

<p>Bad example</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>When you are a parent and you live in a different state as the other parent or your

<h4>Result<a class="headerlink" href="#result" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The result field should contain information that encourages the user to take the action if it applies to them. This should include content under headings like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why should I do this?</p></li>
<li><p>Why shouldn’t I do this?</p></li>
<li><p>What can’t this do for me?</p></li>
<li><p>What can this do for me?</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="legal-step">
<h3>Legal step<a class="headerlink" href="#legal-step" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Legal steps are comprised of directions and tips.</p>
<p>A direction may have multiple paired markup segments to allow us to parse and deliver long blocks of text. A direction should be around a single action. For example a step may have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A direction to file specific bankruptcy forms</p></li>
<li><p>A direction related to waiving court fees</p></li>
<li><p>A tip indicating the amount of the court fee</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is better to break a long direction into multiple segments so that they will work across channels beyond the web.</p>
</div>
<p>Don’t put all the directions in 1 direction. For example, if filling out forms requires one to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fill out the forms</p></li>
<li><p>Sign them</p></li>
<li><p>Make copies</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Those should be 3 separate directions.</p>
<p>If a segment does not ask the user to do something, it should most likely be a tip.</p>

<section id="alt-text">
<h3>Alt text<a class="headerlink" href="#alt-text" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Give every image descriptive alt text, which helps people using screen readers understand the page more fully. Name images using descriptive text; do not use the image name as alt text.
Yes: Picture of a woman walking on a bridge.
No: img78080_woman_on_bridge.jpg</p>

<section id="composition">
<h3>Composition<a class="headerlink" href="#composition" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The images that will work best are horizontal images with the subject(s) in the center of the image. If the subject is on the outer edge it could be cropped out so adjust the photo yourself using a crop tool.
Think about the person who may want to read this content and focus on them when selecting an image.</p>

<section id="reading-level">
<h2>Reading level<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-level" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Target reading level is 6th-8th grade. The reading level will be assessed by running a Flesch-Kincaid test using Readable.io (see Operations site for username and pw). If you cannot get the readability to a 6th-8th grade reading level, see the Legal Content Director for assistance.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There are other tools, like the WriteClearly plugin that you can use to evaluate readability as well.</p>

<h2>People-first language<a class="headerlink" href="#people-first-language" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you are using a word to describe a person, put the word after the word “person.”
YES: Person with a disability
NO: Disabled person</p>
</section>
<section id="acronyms">
<h2>Acronyms<a class="headerlink" href="#acronyms" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Spell out first instance of the acronym in each individual article; do this by writing, not by using parentheses. Some acronyms are better known than their full, formal names (“SSI,” for example) but should still be spelled out in their first instance.</p>
<p>Example: You can apply for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, through the Social Security Administration (SSA). SSI provides income for persons with a disabiliy.</p>

<section id="specific-use-cases">
<h2>Specific use cases<a class="headerlink" href="#specific-use-cases" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Judgement v Judgment - Use “Judgment.”</p></li>
<li><p>PM/AM vs P.M. A.M. vs pm am - Use: AM and PM (no periods)</p></li>
<li><p>“Judge” instead of “court” - Despite this common usage in legalese, do not refer to the judge as “the court.” Only say “the court” if you are talking about the actual courtroom or courthouse.</p></li>
<li><p>Stepparent vs step parent - Use stepparent because it is the more frequent search term on Google.</p></li>
<li><p>COVID-19 v. Covid-19 - Use “Covid-19” instead of “COVID-19.” This is the New York Times approach and it avoids using capitals which is preferred for readability.</p></li>
<li><p>Abbreviate United States as “US” with no spaces or period</p></li>
<li><p>ID - use ID (not id, Id)</p></li>
<li><p>Roska articles -</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the title of the article must comply with the ILAO Style Guide.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, keep this at the beginning of each Roska: The following question was/questions were (pick appropriate one for article) submitted to John Roska, an attorney/writer whose weekly newspaper column, “The Law Q&amp;A,” runs in the Champaign News Gazette.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, include the following two headings: (1) Question [H3] and write question(s) underneath this heading and (2) Answer [H3] and write answer underneath this heading</p></li>
