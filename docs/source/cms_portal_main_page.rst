Portal page types
==================
Despite the content type name of "portal main page", there are three types of portal pages:

* Main page
* Subpages
* Toolbox selector form (deprecated I think)

A portal should have no more than 1 main page and may have an unlimited number of subpages.




Navigation
===========

The main portal page should be linked to in the Quick Links in the footer.  

.. todo:: We will add portal main page where the page type is main page to the legal resources pages to improve findability.
