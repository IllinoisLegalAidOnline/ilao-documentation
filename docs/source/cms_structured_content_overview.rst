Structured content (COPE content) Overview
=============================================

Structured content types were defined in the CMS as a move towards Create Once Publish Everywhere (COPE) model for authoring legal information.

It builds on

The DIY Legal Solution content type is the core wrapper for COPE content.


Every  DIY Legal Solution packages:

* starts with a defined problem (Introduction)
* has a description of the problem
* links to the legal options that one might take to resolve the problem
* may have one or more legal questions that help more fully describe the problem.
* may link to a related guide or basics article ("Learn the basics")
* may link to other resources



Content formats
=================

We have defined two key formats for text-based markup:

* the list format.
* a structured text format

Both formats rely on the "paired content markup" that translates HTML text into plain text with footnoted urls, which will work better on non-web channels.
