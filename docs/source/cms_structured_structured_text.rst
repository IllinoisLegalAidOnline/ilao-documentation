Structured Text & Lists
============================


The structured text and lists component is designed to support either paired markup or structured lists that exist in otherwise unstructured text.

.. note:: For lists such as steps in a How-to and questions in a FAQ, structure is automatically enforced.  But in freestanding text like eligibility rules or answers to questions, we need more structure around lists when those are appropriate to use.

The component is used in:

* Legal solution (for eligibility rules and result)
* Legal question (for answers and suggested answers)

A Structured text block:

* May have a heading
* Must have a body segment.  The body segment must have at least one of:

  * a Paired markup section
  * a List segments section
  
.. note:: You must remove the segment that you are not using in order for the form to validate.

Please see the paired markup documentation on how the paired markup works.
