============================
Toolbox tool content type
============================

Every toolbox should have at least 2 tools. Each tool must have at least 1 step.

.. todo:: Explore the possibility of supporting tools that do not reside inside a toolbox.

Creating or editing a tool
=============================

When creating a tool, add:

* A title
* A relationship to an existing toolbox
* A primary legal category
* A selector form label; this will appear on the toolbox page
* An effort level.  Use easy for anything that can be completed in 1 week or less, medium for anything that takes 1-6 months and hard for anything that typically takes 6 months or more.
* Purpose description.  This appears on the page after a user selects toolboxes.
* Overview.  This is a summary of the tool and appears above the list of steps
* Optionally add a before you get started block to add any critical warnings or other information the user should have before starting
* Optionally add a Learn more section.  This can use an existing guide or be hand-curated.
* Add each tool step in the tools list (these can not be added until the tool steps exist)


Do not use the pick up where I left off field

.. todo:: Add tools to appear in category pages if they do not; proper search handling; add legal issues so that tools can appear in subcategory pages

.. todo:: Remove publishing status field, pick up where I left off field,

What users see
==================

When viewing a tool page a user will see:

* The overview
* The list of steps, numbered under a "Your Progress" block
* A start button to go to the next step
* Before you get started block with an information icon
* A learn more block with a ... icon
