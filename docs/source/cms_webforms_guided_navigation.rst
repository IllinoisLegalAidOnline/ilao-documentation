Webforms for Guided Navigation
===============================

Webforms are used to help us process outcomes from our Guided Navigation triage rules hosted on LegalServer. In Guided Navigation, we triage users to a case category outcome based on a standard set of questions.  We use the webform to capture what case categories a specific service takes. Each field in the webform corrosponds to an outcome field in Guided Navigation and uses the same field key.

.. note::

   For example, Guided Navigation for TANF has an outcome field ilao_tanf_cut_outcome_202 that includes all the possible outcomes for a user who has had TANF benefits cut. Each combination has a number associated with it. In the webform, there is a field labeled "What TANF reduction or ending cases do you take?" with options whose keys align with the Guided Navigation.

Each participating service will have a webform submission with their case acceptance criteria selected. Only the most recent webform submission for a specific service will be used in evaluation.

We can then check to see if the user's outcome is in a service's webform results to find matching organizations, in combination with the associated service and intake settings.
