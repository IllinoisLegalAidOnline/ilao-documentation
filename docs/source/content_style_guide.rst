Content style guide
======================

Titles
============
Capitalization
-----------------
Use sentence case, not title case:
YES: "Getting child support"
NO: "Getting Child Support"

Length
--------
60 characters or less.

Standard formats
-----------------------
* For overview articles, add "basics" at the end. ("Divorce basics")
* For how-to articles that involve a court process, start with "Starting a case to." ("Starting a case to expunge your criminal record").
* Do not include content type
* Do not include the content type ("video," "easy form," etc.)  in the title. It will be added by the website automatically where necessary like in search results.

Jurisdiction
---------------
If the content piece applies statewide or nationally, we don't include geographic/jurisdictional indicator. If it is is less than all of Illinois, then include in the content title.

YES: Dealing with bed bugs in Chicago
NO: Dealing with bed bugs in Illinois

The exception is for IICLEs. If an IICLE has "Illinois" in the title, keep it.

.. note:: Preserving URLs when changing titles

   When changing a title, uncheck the box next to "Generate automatic alias" so that the URL stays the same. This is so that our Google Analytics tracking for the page will be preserved.


Metadata
==========
Meta description and content description
-------------------------------------------
Good meta descriptions are short blurbs that describe accurately the content of the page. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they're looking for. If possilbe, start your meta descriptions and content descriptions with the word "Explains..."

**Descriptions should not repeat/mimic the title.**
Yes: Title: Divorce basics; Meta description: Explains the basics of divorce. Includes requirements, timeline, and fees.
No: Title: Divorce basics; Meta description: The basics of how to get a divorce.

End each description with a period.

In general, do not use “more” or “etc” at the end of the description. Instead, focus on summarizing the main point of the article and don’t worry about including every issue covered by the article in the description.

Write the content description first, and then copy and paste it into the meta description. There is no need to add more text to the meta description just because the character limit is higher. But feel free to utilize it if you think there is more helpful information to include in the description.

.. note:: The content description is used on the website while the meta description is used in social media and external search engines like Google.

Legal category
------------------

Navigational IA & Legal issues IA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tag the content to the best category you can find. One is the goal - only tag multiple categories if the content truly fits both places.

If you tag a piece of content to a taxonomy tag that starts with "another" or "other," do not tag that piece of content to any other taxonomy tags, except another "another" or "other" tag in a different topic.

.. note:: The navigational IA will be used in the future for browsing articles from the home page down and the legal issues categories will continue to be used to deliver content via Get Legal Help

Primary legal category
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pick the top-level category that you think best fits the content.


Image
------------
Every piece of content should have an image associated with it. This will be displayed on social media and other places the content is shared.

Use iStock to find a photo that is engaging and describes the content. Download the Small version and put it on Team Drive in the "Stock Photos" folder in the appropriate sub-folder.

The images that will work best are horizontal images with the subject(s) in the center of the image. If the subject is on the outer edge it could be cropped out so adjust the photo yourself using a crop tool.

Annual updates
----------------
Only use this section if there is information in the content that will change regularly.

This includes:

* Legal content that contains the minimum wage
* Legal content that contains dates that change year to year
* Legal content that contains income levels or benefits levels that change each year


Do not tag these just because the content deals with that issue - only if something in the content is definitely going to change regularly.


Jurisdiction
--------------
Most of our content is "All of Illinois," but if the content applies to federal law (Immigration, Bankruptcy, etc.) or only a specific locality (usually Cook County or Chicago) you can indicate that here.


Legal position
-----------------
Use "Neutral" unless the content is only talking about one side in a legal proceeding. For example, if the content is telling the user how to change your name, you would set this to Plaintiff. If the content is talking about how to defend against a debt collection lawsuit, set this to Defendant (but note that if the content is talking about the other side - how to collect a judgment - it would be Plaintiff).

Be careful to use the actual position in the case. For example, for criminal records, you are the plaintiff, because you are filing a petition to expunge. You are not the defendant (even though you were in the criminal case).

Content level
----------------
Use "Advanced" if the content is clearly talking to lawyers. For example, it talks about working with a client.

Otherwise, use "Basic."

Restrictions and exclusions
------------------------------
Only restrict to Legal Aid users if it is an IICLE. Otherwise do not use that field.


Body text
=============
Headings/Subheadings
-----------------------------
Subheadings should be used as they are helpful to a user when scanning a page. There are 3 levels of subheadings:

* Heading 3 (h3),
* Heading 4 (h4), and
* Heading 5 (h5).

There must be atleast one h3 before an h4, and at least one h4 before an h5. This includes process articles.

.. warning:: Headings should not be used solely for the purpose of style!

You can use headings and subheadings instead of using nested bullets, if the bullets go more than two levels down.

When deciding between using bullets and using subheadings:

* use bullets when

  * the text of the items are 2-3 sentences or less, or
  * when it is a series of items in a list or sequence.

* Use subheadings when
  * they are different aspects or considerations under the same parent heading, or
  * when the items are more than 3 sentences.

Tables
--------
Tables should have at least 2 or more rows and 2 - 4 columns (4 or more columns are difficult to read. Use sentence caps for table titles and column headings.

.. todo:: Add responsive table considerations

Glossary terms/definitions
-----------------------------
Try and avoid using terms that need to be defined. If the word/term needs a definition, define it using plain language once in the bundle or article. If the word/term is used more than once in the bundle or article, make sure it is included in the glossary as we will rely on the glossary for the times it is used after it is first defined.

Point of view
-----------------
Use 3rd person when giving general information, or when using 2nd person would be confusing or would result in awkward phrasing. Use 2nd person when you are giving the user instructions. Often, an article will start in 3rd person (because it's general information) and then shift into 2nd person when the info becomes more specific and you start giving instructions.

Good example

.. code-block:: html

   When parents live in different states or a child and their parents move from one state
    to another, there are laws about which state’s courts can decide issues about the
    custody of the child. [3rd person because it is general info and using 2nd person
    would be awkward] [a few sentences later...] If jurisdiction is an issue in your
    case, you should talk to a lawyer. [2nd person because it tells the user to do
    something]

Bad example

.. code-block:: html

   When you are a parent and you live in a different state as the other parent or your
   child and you and the other parent move from one state to another, there are laws
   about which state’s courts can decide issues about the custody of you child....

Formatting
-------------

Italics
^^^^^^^^^
Italics should be rarely used.

* Court forms should be italicized. This includes shortened versions of their names. For example, if you refer to a Notice of Appeal  as "the Notice" later in the article, you would still italicize it.
* Any editors notes (like at the very beginning of a blog where we give the author's byline).
* Legal citations, case law, and book title.


Bold
^^^^^^^^
Only bold individual words or phrases; never bold an entire sentence or paragraph. Use for the rare instance of subheadings in an article, or when there is an important deadline, alert or notice for the reader to note.

Underline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Don't ever use.

Underline is reserved to display hyperlinks.

ALL CAPS
^^^^^^^^^^^
Don't ever use.

Spacing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Between sentences us one space, not two.

Between paragraphs, use one hard return, not two.

Bulleted and numbered lists
----------------------------

* Use bullets (unordered lists) when there is no sequence to the items
* Use numbers (ordered lists) when there is

Introduce bullets/numbers with a sentence or fragment followed by a colon.

* If it starts with a fragment, the items in the list should be fragments, and should complete the sentence.
* If it starts with a complete sentence, the items can either be fragments or sentences.

Always:

* Capitalize the first word following the bullet point/number.
* Put a comma at the end of each item, even if there are commas within the item itself.
* Use "and" or "or" as appropriate at the end of the second-to-last item. Put a period at the end of the last item.

EXAMPLE:

.. code-block:: html

   The judge will:

   * Hear both sides,
   * Make a decision, and
   * Sign an Order.

There should only be one hierarchical level for bullet lists. A second level may be used only when absolutely necessary. (See Page Design in Content Design London's Readability Guidelines.)


Grammar and Usage
====================
Voice
--------

Use active voice as much as possible.

Verb tense
-------------
Use present tense as much as possible.

Contractions
----------------
Contractions are acceptable when used for plain language. Do not use informal contractions.

And/Or
----------
Do not use "and/or" where it will cause confusing ambiguity. Use it sparingly if it avoids confusion between two or more equally viable options.

He/She/Them
--------------
Do not use he/she or he or she. Use gender neutral terms.

**It is OK to use plural gender neutral pronouns for singular objects**, as in "The judge will make their decision.

Punctuation
=============
Colons
---------
Use at the end of a sentence or fragment that introduces a list.

Semi-colons
---------------
Do not use semicolons. Separate into two sentences with a period.

Commas
----------
A period is better than a comma, but a comma is better than no comma.

Use the oxford comma in a series consisting of three or more elements, separate each element with a comma.

Example: Diversity, equity, and inclusion. NOT: Diversity, equity and inclusion.

Double quotes
----------------
Double quotes can be used when introducing/defining a word for the first time.


Periods
------------
Use periods at the end of each sentence.

Do not use periods when items appear in bulleted lists. Instead, use commas. (see "bulleted lists" above)

Hyphen
Hyphenate two or more words that precede and modify a noun as a unit if confusion might otherwise result. Do not hyphenate for adverbs ending in "ly."

Do not use
--------------

* Exclamation points
* Single quotes (use double quotes)
* Semi-colons (separate into two sentences with a period)
* Parentheses. Avoid using them. They are confusing to people with lower reading levels.
* Em dash
* Slash. Use 'and' or 'or' instead.
* Ampersand (&)


En dash
Use to indicate a range. Do not space on either side of an en dash.

Capitalization
=================

* Capitalize proper names
* Capitalize specific courts or judges but do not capitalize when speaking generally of court, judges, or clerk.  For example:

  * Judge Joe Smith
  * the judge on the case
  * The Illinois Supreme Court
  * the court in your county


* Criminal offenses are not capitalized.
* Organization names should use title case
* Circuit Clerk, Court Clerk, or Clerk should never be capitalized. Use 'circuit clerk', 'county clerk,' or 'clerk'.


Numbers & Currency
=====================

* Spell out 'zero' and 'one'; use digits otherwise.
* Use commas in numbers of 4 or more digits.
* Use dollar sign. Only use decimals if there are cents (not ".00").

Phone number format
======================
(xxx) xxx-xxxx

Dates
========
Spell out month, xx day, xxxx year (American English); xx day, month, year (non-English).

Examples:
* May 7, 2021
* November 12, 1984


Hyperlinks
============
Don't hyperlink words like "click here" or "more."  Instead, hyperlink the specific words (preferably nouns) that describe the information on the page being linked to. For example: "Find more information on the Illinois Courts website."


Connecting to external resources
------------------------------------
Always link when you can over download.

In other words, if there is a PDF we want to create content for, we should try to create a "link" form to the URL where that form is hosted on an external site like a circuit clerk's site, instead of downloading the form and re-uploading as a "download" form. This is so that if the form is updated we will be alerted because the link will break.

External links
------------------
External links should only be used to send users to forms or resources on pages that are run by government agencies or reputable non-profits.  Do not link users to private attorneys' websites, political websites, or generic informational websites (like ask.com or wikipedia).


Links to legal authority
---------------------------
When linking to Illinois statutes, link to the ILGA website's version. Bring people to the Article level, or Title level if Article is unavailable.

For federal statutes, link them to the LII website https://www.law.cornell.edu/.

For caselaw, link them to Google Scholar.

Links to Statewide Forms
--------------------------
When you refer to a Statewide Form, hyperlink the name of it to the AOIC page for that form suite (or that specific form) the first time you refer to it. After that, you don't need to hyperlink it each time.

.. note:: If ILAO has automated the statewide form, we should reference our Easy Form instead. The Easy Form landing page will have the link to the AOIC PDF version as well.

Legal Citations
-----------------
Dealing with citations, statutes, regulations, & case law
We do not use citations in content that is designed for the general public. We do use them in Advanced content, though. In that case, use Blue Book.

Specific Content Formats
==========================
File content
------------------
All files should be uploaded in PDF format.  For forms, link to the clerk's website if possible rather than attaching a file.


Naming conventions for uploaded files - images, docs, pdfs, etc.
all_lowercase_with_underscore and no more than 64 characters.

Videos
----------
If we have a recording of recent legal training or have produced a video internally, it should be posted to to YouTube and then embedded in a piece of content. If the video is of a training, and the speaker used a powerpoint, that powerpoint should be posted with the video.  Other materials that were used by the speaker, like forms or other samples, should also be posted.

Forms
--------
Include a link to another piece of content that explains how to use the form in the "Qualifications" section. This is usually the "Big Picture" article in the related bundle, but it could be another article.

When referring to Easy Forms, say "Easy Form program" or simply "Easy Form."
Do not use any of the following:
Interview
Automated document (or "autodoc")

Form preparation program
A2J
AutoDoc



Images
============
Alt text
--------------
Give every image descriptive alt text, which helps people using screen readers understand the page more fully. Name images using descriptive text; do not use the image name as alt text.
Yes: Picture of a woman walking on a bridge.
No: img78080_woman_on_bridge.jpg

Composition
---------------
The images that will work best are horizontal images with the subject(s) in the center of the image. If the subject is on the outer edge it could be cropped out so adjust the photo yourself using a crop tool.
Think about the person who may want to read this content and focus on them when selecting an image.


Reading level
================
Target reading level is 6th-8th grade. The reading level will be assessed by running a Flesch-Kincaid test using Readable.io (see Operations site for username and pw). If you cannot get the readability to a 6th-8th grade reading level, see the Legal Content Director for assistance.

People-first language
=========================
If you are using a word to describe a person, put the word after the word "person."
YES: Person with a disability
NO: Disabled person

Acronyms
============
Spell out first instance of the acronym in each individual article; do this by writing, not by using parentheses. Some acronyms are better known than their full, formal names ("SSI," for example) but should still be spelled out in their first instance.

Example: You can apply for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, through the Social Security Administration. SSI provides income for persons with a disabiliy.

Specific use cases
======================
* Judgement v Judgment - Use "Judgment."
* PM/AM vs P.M. A.M. vs pm am - Use: AM and PM (no periods)
* "Judge" instead of "court" - Despite this common usage in legalese, do not refer to the judge as "the court." Only say "the court" if you are talking about the actual courtroom or courthouse.
* Stepparent vs step parent - Use stepparent because it is the more frequent search term on Google.
* COVID-19 v. Covid-19 - Use "Covid-19" instead of "COVID-19." This is the New York Times approach and it avoids using capitals which is preferred for readability.
* Abbreviate United States as "US" with no spaces or period
* ID - use ID (not id, Id)
* Roska articles -

  * the title of the article must comply with the ILAO Style Guide.
  * Next, keep this at the beginning of each Roska: The following question was/questions were (pick appropriate one for article) submitted to John Roska, an attorney/writer whose weekly newspaper column, "The Law Q&A," runs in the Champaign News Gazette.
  * Then, include the following two headings: (1) Question [H3] and write question(s) underneath this heading and (2) Answer [H3] and write answer underneath this heading
