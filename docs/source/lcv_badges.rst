There are 6 badges for each legal category:

* Hero
* Leader

* Workhorse
* Author
* Partner

There are also 3 "Champion" badges per category (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

Badge Definitions
===================
The badges can be configured in the CMS. Badges may be configured:

* for a specific legal category or all categories. 
* the maximum number of times a badge can be earned:

  * no limit means as soon as the user hits the number of points required, they earn the badge.  For example, the hero badge could be set to be awarded when a user has earned 100 points in Family & Safety.  If a user earns 300 points in Quarter 2, they would earn the badge 3 times.
  * once means the user can only earn the badge one time ever.  For example, if the Partner badge is set at 10,000 points for Family & Safety, and a user hits 10,005 points on January 4, 2022 and 20,001 points on June 6, 2022, they would only see one Family & Safety Partner badge.
  * once per quarter means the user can earn the badge once a quarter maximum.  For example, if the Workhorse badge is set at 500 points for Family & Safety, and a user hits 501 points on January 4, 2022, 1007 points on February 3, 2022 and then earns 505 points on April 1, 2022, the user would earn the workhouse on January 4 and April 1.  No additional workhorse badge would be earned on February 3.
  * once per year means the user can earn the badge once a year maximum.  For example, if the Leader badge is set at 500 points for Family & Safety, and a user hits 501 points on January 4, 2022, 1007 points on February 3, 2022 and then earns 505 points on April 1, 2023, the user would earn the workhouse on January 4, 2022 and April 1, 2023.  No additional workhorse badge would be earned on February 3.
