====================
LCV Leaderboards
====================

There are three leaderboards:

* Overall individual leaderboard
* Organization leaderboard
* Organization editor leaderboard

Content editor leaderboard
============================

* highlights the top 3 point earners for the current quarter as of the last update (usually the night before).
* includes:

  * a listing of next 10 users.  This should default to the page that the user appears on.  For example, if the user is #7, then the first page (showing 1 - 10) should show.  If the user is #25, the third page (showing 21 - 30) should show.  
  * a block of milestones earned in the current quarter
