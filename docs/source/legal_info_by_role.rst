Legal info by population
===========================

We can also provide legal information targeted to specific user populations, based on our intake populations taxonomy. This includes users who are:

* a veteran, active duty military or have had military service
* a senior (60 years or older)
* a youth (17 years or younger)
* a survivor of abuse or crime (domestic violence, trafficking, sexual assault, gun
* homeless or at risk of homelessness
* living with a disability
* have a family or household member who is or was in jail or prison
* living with HIV/AIDS
* an immigrant to the U.S. or undocumented
* in jail or prison
* a non-profit organization or small business

Individual pieces of legal content can now be tagged to one of these populations and will then be available in the resources tab under a "I am ..." with the taxonomy terms listed.
