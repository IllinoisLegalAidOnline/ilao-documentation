Next Steps Flows
=======================

"Next Steps" is designed to provide additional support to individuals along their legal journey. In phase 1, we are focusing on making the tool available to caseworkers at OTIS partner organizations to subscribe clients to these next steps. As they provide advice, they can use a component in LegalServer to assign a client to a completed step and subscribe them to follow up messages.

Phase 2 envisions expanding it to website visitors and users of our ILAOHelps! SMS text line and an expansion to web notifications and email processing.

Next Steps build on the work done with COPE content to define step-by-step legal processes (How-tos) associated with a specific DIY Legal Solution and its options. This adds a content type designed to deliver interactive follow-up messages initially over SMS.

How this differs from the Toolbox ticker system
=================================================

Some staff may recall that we piloted a similar concept with toolbox content. We've learned from that failure and have made the following improvements in this iteration:

* Messages are kept separate from the content associated with it. This makes it easier to view the overall flow for a legal process.
* Users can reply to a message and those replies are then processed to determine the next step, rather than just a "Hey, it's been a couple of weeks. If you have your criminal records together, the next step is to determine whether you are eligible for sealing."
