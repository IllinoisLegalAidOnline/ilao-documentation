Manipulating Search
=========================

Synonyms
==========

The search synonyms taxonomy allows us to:

* Replace a search term with another search term
* Expand a search term with additional search terms

The search synonym taxonomy:

* The name is the search term as entered by the user
* The description is what is used to replace or expand
* The synonym type is either:

  * Replace name with description.  
  * Add description terms to name.  

Replacing a search term
-------------------------
This feature is helpful for misspellings.  For example, a synonym of divrce with a description of divorce will result in the system searching just for divorce.  


Add description terms to name
-------------------------------
This feature is helpful for true synonyms.  For example, adding weed as a synonym for cannabis with a type of "add description terms to name" will return content with either term.

Best Bets
===========

Best bets allow us to designate a specific node as the "best bet" for a specific search term.  The user must enter the exact search term for the best bet to be picked up.  

This feature is only available for  the following content types:

* Legal content
* Portal main page
* Toolboxes

.. note::  Only one node can be associated with a search term as a best bet.  If anyone attempts to add a duplicate, the following message will appear:  "One or more of your search terms already has a best bet. Please review the best bet report and remove duplicates."

.. todo:: We need to build the best bet report.
