Indexing and Updates
======================

The search index can be:

* Manually indexed completely (Administrator only)
* Automatically when content is saved. This can be done by:

  * Editing and saving a single piece of content
  * Using the `admin/content page <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/content>`_, selecting items to save and using the "Save content" feature when bulk editing. This is useful when something seems funny and you need to reindex an entire content type.
  
.. warning::  The default action is delete content. Be careful that you change the setting to save content first. 

.. todo:: Update the bulk options on admin/content to remove delete content and other unused options.
